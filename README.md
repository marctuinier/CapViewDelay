## What It Does

By default, when you take a screenshot on macOS, a small preview appears in the corner of your screen for about 5 seconds. This utility provides a simple interface to change that duration to any value you prefer.

## Installation

1.  Go to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/your-username/CapViewDelay/releases).
2.  Download the latest `.dmg` file.
3.  Open the DMG, and drag the **CapViewDelay.app** icon into your **Applications** folder.

*Note: Since this app is not from the App Store, the first time you open it, you may need to right-click the app icon and select "Open" from the menu.*

## How to Use

1.  Launch the CapViewDelay app.
2.  Enter the desired duration in seconds (e.g., `10` for 10 seconds, `0` to disable the thumbnail).
3.  Click "Set Duration".
4.  The change is applied immediately. You can now close the app.
